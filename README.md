# udemy-web-dev-bootcamp
A repository of projects created from the Udemy Web developer Bootcamp

For the most part, these projects are websites containing separate CSS and Javascript files.
If you'd like to view these sites, download the 3 parts into the same folder and open the html from your browser. 
By convention, each file starting with the same number should be downloaded together. (i.e. XX-project.html, XX-project.css, XX-script.js all correspond to project number XX).
